# Traction Documentation and Resources

## A Traction Sandbox ACA-Py/AnonCreds Workshop

This workshop contains a sequence of labs demonstrating issuing, receiving,
holding, requesting, presenting, and verifying AnonCreds Verifiable
Credentials--no technical experience required! The labs take about 20 minutes
for complete. New developers expecting to build an Issuer or Verifier with
[Traction] or [ACA-Py] will find this a great place to
start--with developer-oriented "Next Steps" suggested at the end of the
Workshop.
