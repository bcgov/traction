    This is the model for the Tenant Configuration table. This is configuration for how
    the tenant will/can interact with Traction.

    Each tenant is responsible for setting their own configuration. However, some values
    will only apply if the Innkeeper has given them permission (ex. store message data).


    Attributes:
      tenant_id: Traction Tenant ID
      webhook_url: a url that will receive webhook data pushed from Traction.
      webhook_key: this will be sent as the X-API-Key header to the webhook_url. This
       allows the tenant to secure their webhook_url.
      auto_respond_messages: This allows each tenant to effectively set their own value
       for the AcaPy `auto-respond-messages` flag. Default is True
      auto_response_message: when auto_respond_messages is True, this is the message
       that is delivered. If auto_respond_messages is True and no value set, a default
       message will be returned.
      store_messages: when True, the messages will be stored. Requires Innkeeper
        permission.
      store_issuer_credentials: when True, the data used to create a credential offer
       will be stored. Requires Innkeeper permission.
