Feature: holding presentations

    Background: two tenants, 1 issuer/verifier and 1 holder
        Given we have authenticated at the innkeeper
        And we have "2" traction tenants
        # verifier will also be the issuer
        | name  | role    |
        | faber | verifier |
        | alice | prover |
        And "faber" is an issuer
        And we sadly wait for 5 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "faber" and "alice" are connected
        And issuer creates new schema(s) and cred def(s)
        |issuer|schema_name|attrs|cred_def_tag|rev_reg_size|
        |faber|useless-schema|name,title|test|0|
        And check "faber" for 120 seconds for a status of "Active" for "useless-schema"
        And "faber" issues "alice" a "useless-schema" credential
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "alice" will have a credential_offer from "faber"
        And "alice" will accept credential_offer from "faber"
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        Then "alice" will have a holder credential with status "Accepted"
        And "faber" will have an "Issued" issuer credential
        And "alice" will have 1 holder credential(s)


    Scenario: holder can propose a presentation to verifier
        When "alice" proposes a presentation to "faber"
        And we sadly wait for 5 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "alice" will have 1 holder presentation(s)
        And "alice" can find 1 credential(s) for holder presentation
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        Then "alice" will have a holder presentation with status "Presentation Received"
        And "faber" has a "verified" verifier presentation


    Scenario: holder proposes an empty presentation
        When "alice" proposes an empty presentation to "faber"
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "alice" will have 1 holder presentation(s)
        And "alice" will have a holder presentation with status "Error"
        And "alice" can find 0 credential(s) for holder presentation
        And "faber" has a "rejected" verifier presentation
