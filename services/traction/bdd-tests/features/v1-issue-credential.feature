Feature: issuing credentials

    Background: two tenants, 1 issuer can write schema and cred_def
        Given we have authenticated at the innkeeper
        And we have "2" traction tenants
        | name  | role    |
        | alice | issuer |
        | faber | holder |
        And "alice" is an issuer
        And we sadly wait for 5 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "alice" and "faber" are connected
        And issuer creates new schema(s) and cred def(s)
        |issuer|schema_name|attrs|cred_def_tag|rev_reg_size|
        |alice|useless-schema|name,title|test|0|
        And check "alice" for 120 seconds for a status of "Active" for "useless-schema"

    Scenario: offer a credential to an active contact
        When "alice" issues "faber" a "useless-schema" credential
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        Then "faber" will have a credential_offer from "alice"
        And "alice" can get the issuer credential

    Scenario: holder will accept an offered credential to an active contact
        When "alice" issues "faber" a "useless-schema" credential
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "faber" will have a credential_offer from "alice"
        # this loads data into context.config
        And "faber" will accept credential_offer from "alice"
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        Then "faber" will have a credential
        And "alice" will have an "Issued" issuer credential
        And "alice" can get the issuer credential

    Scenario: issuer will revoke an accepted credential
        Given issuer creates new schema(s) and cred def(s)
        |issuer|schema_name|attrs|cred_def_tag|rev_reg_size|
        |alice|revocable-schema|name,title|test|4|
        And check "alice" for 120 seconds for a status of "Active" for "revocable-schema"
        When "alice" issues "faber" a "revocable-schema" credential
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        And "faber" will have a credential_offer from "alice"
        # this loads data into context.config
        And "faber" will accept credential_offer from "alice"
        And we sadly wait for 10 seconds because we have not figured out how to listen for events
        Then "faber" will have a credential
        And "alice" will have an "Issued" issuer credential
        When "alice" revokes credential from "faber"
        Then "alice" will have an "Revoked" issuer credential
        And "alice" can get the issuer credential

    Scenario: issuer can import schema
        Given issuer imports schema(s)
        |issuer|schema_id|name|cred_def_tag|rev_reg_size|
        |alice|9vnQTCy6NQ7mxUVhLtaPZY:2:registration.registries.ca:1.0.42|registration-schema|test|4|
        And check "alice" for 120 seconds for a status of "Active" for "registration-schema"
