### developer notes

- install python 3.6.13
- install poetry version 1.1.11
- the base docker image is python 3.6.13, so best to develop using that version
- there are issues using poetry lock files generated by a newer version, then run using an older version. the dockerfile
  uses 1.1.11, so stick with that

### build and run

```
cd docker
docker build -f ./Dockerfile --tag basicmessage_storage ..
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 --rm basicmessage_storage
```

### notes

- v1_0: uses a middleware wrapper around the existing basicmessage `connections/{id}/send-message` api, and will persist
  the sent message. messages between all agents/connections can be fetched via `GET /basicmessages` with optional query params for `connection_id` and `state`.
