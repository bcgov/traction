Hyperledger Aries Traction - a digital wallet solution for organizations. The focus of Traction is for line of businesses to easily integrate Aries (aca-py) into their applications; without having to stand up, maintain and manage and instance of aca-py themselves.

Traction provides a service layer to manage Aries agent instances in a multi-tenant aca-py deployment, and provides some value-add services for using aca-py functions such as setting up issuer agents, and issuing and verifying credentials.  Future functionality could include machine-readable governance, etc.

## Quick start

To run a local instance of traction, open a bash shell and run the following (git, docker and docker-compose are required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcgov.traction.git
cd traction/scripts
cp .env-example .env
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Open the following in a browser: `http://localhost:5100/innkeeper/docs` - this is the swagger UI for the innkeeper.

After you authenticate using `innkeeper/change-me` you can create a new tenant using the `/tenant/check-in` function.  Make a note of the `wallet_id` and `wallet_key` - you will need these to access traction as a tenant.

Open another browser and connect to `http://localhost:5100/tenant/docs`.  Authenticate using the `wallet_id/wallet_key` from the previous step.

See the [use case](./docs/USE-CASE.md) document for more detailed information about traction services.

To run the showcase application, open a second bash shell and run the following:

```bash
cd traction/scripts
docker-compose -f docker-compose.showcase.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.showcase.yml up
```

Open a browser to `http://localhost:5200` to access the showcase application.

See the [use case](./docs/USE-CASE.md) document for more detailed information about how to run the showcase demo.
